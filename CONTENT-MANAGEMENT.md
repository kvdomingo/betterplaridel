## Understanding the Content Structure

The website content is organized in folders by service categories. The `content` folder is located at the root level of the repository (not inside the `src` folder). Here's how it works:

```
content/services/
├── agriculture-fisheries/
├── business/
├── disaster-preparedness/
├── education/
├── environment/
├── garbage-waste-disposal/
├── health-services/
├── housing-land-use/
├── infrastructure-public-works/
└── social-welfare/
```

### Two Types of Files

1. **Index Files** (`index.yaml`) - These list all the services in a category
2. **Content Files** (`.md` files) - These contain the actual service information

---

## Editing Content Files

### Step 1: Navigate to the File

1. Go to the GitHub repository in your web browser
2. Click on the `content` folder (at the root level)
3. Click on `services` folder
4. Choose the category folder (e.g., `education`)
5. Click on the file you want to edit (e.g., `apply-for-local-scholarships.md`)

### Step 2: Edit the File

1. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) in the top-right corner of the file view
2. Make your changes in the text editor
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page

### Step 3: Save Your Changes

1. In the "Commit changes" section at the bottom:
   - **Commit message**: Write a brief description of what you changed
   - Example: "Updated scholarship application requirements"
2. Click **"Commit changes"** button

### Step 4: Verify Your Changes

1. The page will refresh and show your updated content
2. You can see the changes in the file history

## Adding New Services

### Method 1: Adding a New Service to an Existing Category

#### Step 1: Create the Content File

1. Navigate to the category folder (e.g., `education`)
2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Create new file"**
3. Name the file using this format: `your-service-name.md`
   - Use lowercase letters and hyphens
   - Example: `apply-for-summer-job-programs.md`
4. Add your content using the markdown format (see formatting guide below)
5. Click **"Commit new file"**

#### Step 2: Update the Index File

1. Go back to the category folder
2. Click on `index.yaml`
3. Click the pencil icon to edit
4. Add your new service to the list:

```yaml
pages:
  - name: 'Your Service Name'
    slug: 'your-service-name'
    description: 'Brief description of the service.'
```

5. Save the changes

### Method 2: Creating a New Category

#### Step 1: Create the Category Folder

1. Go to `content/services/`
2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Create new file"**
3. Name it: `your-category-name/index.yaml`
4. Add the basic structure:

```yaml
# Your Category Name Pages
# This file contains all the pages/services available under the Your Category Name category

pages:
  - name: 'Your First Service'
    slug: 'your-first-service'
    description: 'Description of your first service.'
```

#### Step 2: Create Service Content Files

Follow the same process as Method 1 to add individual service files.

## Markdown Formatting Guide

Markdown is a simple way to format text. Here are the most common formatting options:

### Headers

```markdown
# Main Title (largest)

## Section Title

### Subsection Title

#### Smaller Title
```

### Text Formatting

```markdown
**Bold text**
_Italic text_
`Code or special terms`
```

### Lists

```markdown
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
  - Sub-bullet point

1. Numbered list item 1
2. Numbered list item 2
```

### Links

```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

### Tables

```markdown
| Column 1     | Column 2     | Column 3     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 |
```

### Horizontal Lines

```markdown
---
```

### Blockquotes

```markdown
> This is a quote or important note
```

## Best Practices

### Content Writing Tips

1. **Use Clear, Simple Language**
   - Write for the general public
   - Avoid technical jargon
   - Use short sentences and paragraphs

2. **Be Specific and Helpful**
   - Include exact steps to follow
   - Mention required documents
   - Provide contact information when possible

3. **Include Practical Information**
   - Office hours
   - Required documents
   - Processing time
   - Fees (if any)
   - Contact details

### Service Title and Description Pattern

When creating services, use this pattern for titles and descriptions to make them more citizen-friendly:

#### ✨ Pattern Formula

**[Action verb] + [service/benefit] + [who/where/why if needed]**

#### Guidelines

- **Start with an action verb**: Get, Access, Go, Join, Apply, Secure, Take, Receive
- **Keep it short and simple**: usually 5–10 words
- **Citizen-focused**: written in "you" language, no jargon
- **Outcome-based**: highlights the benefit or purpose of the service

#### Good Examples

- Apply for a Health Card for work or study
- Secure a Sanitary Permit for your business
- Take a free rabies vaccination after an animal bite
- Get free family planning counseling and services
- Receive free TB testing and medicines
- Access educational support programs from the LGU
- Join health programs for nutrition and dengue control
- Go to the local hospital for treatment or confinement

#### What to Avoid

❌ "Health Card Application Process" (too technical)

❌ "Sanitary Permit Requirements" (not action-oriented)

❌ "LGU Educational Support Services" (jargon-heavy)

✅ "Apply for a Health Card for work or study"

✅ "Secure a Sanitary Permit for your business"

✅ "Access educational support programs from the LGU"

### File Organization

1. **Use Descriptive File Names**
   - `apply-for-local-scholarships.md` ✅
   - `scholarship.md` ❌

2. **Keep Descriptions Short**
   - Index file descriptions should be 1-2 sentences
   - Focus on what the service does

3. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Use the same format for similar services
   - Follow the existing structure

### Content Structure Template

```markdown
# Service Name — Location

Brief introduction explaining what this service is for.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "I can't find the file I want to edit"

- Make sure you're in the right folder path: `content/services/[category]/`
- Check if the file exists by looking at the folder contents
- Remember: the `content` folder is at the root level of the repository, not inside `src`

#### "My changes aren't showing up"

- Make sure you clicked "Commit changes" after editing
- Check that you're looking at the right file
- Wait a few minutes for changes to appear on the live site

#### "I made a mistake and want to undo changes"

- Go to the file you edited
- Click on "History" (clock icon)
- Find the version before your changes
- Click "Revert" to undo

#### "I can't create a new file"

- Make sure you have permission to edit the repository
- Check that you're in the right folder
- Try refreshing the page and starting over

#### "The formatting looks wrong"

- Check that you're using the correct markdown syntax
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters
- Compare with existing files that work correctly

### Getting Help

If you're still having trouble:

1. **Check existing files for examples**

- Look at similar files to see how they're formatted
- Copy the structure of working files

2. **Ask for help**

- Contact the project administrator
- Ask a colleague who has used GitHub before

3. **Start small**

- Make small changes first to get comfortable
- Practice with less important content before editing critical information
